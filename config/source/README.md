# Color Sources

This directory contains source files (slightly modified in some cases) from
which we import various color schemes to be converted to our internal format.

The scripts in the [bin/import](../../bin/import) directory are used to
import the data.  The output palette data is written to files in the
[../palette](../palette) directory.
